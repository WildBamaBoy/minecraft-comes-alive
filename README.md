Minecraft Comes Alive
=====================
[Minecraft Comes Alive](http://www.radix-shock.com/mca--overview.html) (MCA) is a Minecraft mod that replaces Minecraft's Testificates with humans. It works in single player, LAN, and SMP.

Humans can be interacted with. You can talk to them, ask them to follow you, set their home, give them gifts, etc. Interacting with people builds relationships. Get your relationship high enough and you will be able to marry someone.
After getting married, you will be able to have children who will do many chores for you such as: Farming, Fishing, Woodcutting, Hunting, and Mining.

Children will eventually grow up into adults. Adults can get married and have children of their own. This cycle can repeat indefinitely.

## Dependencies
MCA depends on [RadixCore](https://github.com/WildBamaBoy/radix-core) in order to function.
